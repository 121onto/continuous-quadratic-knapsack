# Algorithms for solving the continuous quadratic knapsack problem

This code is based on the following paper:

M. Patriksson and C. Strömberg. Algorithms for the continuous
nonlinear resource allocation problem – new implementations
and numerical studies. *European Journal of Operational Research*, 243(3):703–722, 2015.

Built and tested using python 3.5.

Suggestions, bug reports, and improvements are welcome.

**Notes**: code is an alpha release and is not thoroughly tested.  Existing tests use scipy.optimize.minimize.
